User Movement Data Heatmap & SD Calculation

This script processes user movement data to generate probability heatmaps and compute standard deviation (SD) of movement patterns over time.

Features

	•	Heatmap Generation: Visualize movement data on a 201x201 grid.
	•	SD Calculation: Compute standard deviation of movement across multiple days.
	•	Parallel Processing: Efficient analysis using Python’s multiprocessing.

Usage

	•	Modify csv_file to your dataset.
	•	Adjust user IDs and time range in the script.
	•	Run to generate visualizations and statistics.
 
People Flow Analysis with Stable Matrix

This repository contains Python code for analyzing and visualizing people flow data using a concept called the “stable matrix.” The primary goal of the project is to understand how the number of people changes across different hours of the day, with dynamic visualizations generated for different percentage scenarios.

Features

	•	Data Visualization: Plots showing the number of people over time (hourly), based on the provided stable matrix data.
	•	Dynamic Analysis: The stable matrix is analyzed for different percentage scenarios, with results dynamically labeled for better understanding.
	•	Matplotlib Integration: Clean visual representations using matplotlib for plotting the data.

Requirements

	•	Python 3.x
	•	Matplotlib

Usage

Run the best_percentage.py to generate the plots for the stable matrix analysis. You can adjust the percentages as needed for different visual outputs.
